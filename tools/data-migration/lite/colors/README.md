# Small script to migrate lite and lite-xl color schemes to ecode color schemes.

## Usage

You'll need to have installed lua binary, then run:

`lua lite2ecode.lua lite_color_scheme.lua > color_scheme_name.conf`

Then you can copy the language definition to the [ecode color schemes folder](https://github.com/SpartanJ/ecode/?tab=readme-ov-file#custom-editor-color-schemes).

If you want to ecode support the color schemes that you're porting in the base install please [open an issue](https://github.com/SpartanJ/ecode/issues) and share the color scheme.
